A reusable implementation of the Simulated Annealing metaheuristic for optimization problems

Files:

MANIFEST.in		-	Defines what will be in the final installer tarball
README			-	This file
runner			-	Python script to import this application's modules and launch
setup.py		-	distutil setup file
simanneal/		-	Simulated Annealing Package
	__init__.py	-	Used by distutils to find the package root, should be empty
	Annealer.py	-	Core implementation
	samples/	-	Sample package
		__init__.py		-	Used by distutils to find the package root, should be empty
		samplebase.py	-	Base class for samples, implements some simple defaults, children should only override what changes
		trivial.py		-	Sample of using Annealer to optimize a small one-dimensional array
		twodimensional.py	-	Sample of using Annealer to optimize a small two-dimensional array
		threedimensional.py	-	Guess what this does.
		visualizer.py		-	tkinter-based visualizer with threading for Annealer results (reusable for other data)
	tests/		-	Unit tests
		Annealer.py			- Unit tests for the core Annealer module
		twodimensional.py	- Unit tests for Sample, as implemented in twodimesional (yeah, unusual)
