A basic application template for packing Python modules with distutils.

Files:

MANIFEST.in		-	Defines what will be in the final installer tarball (see note 1)
README			-	This file
runner			-	Python script to import this application's modules and launch
setup.py		-	distutil setup file
main_package/	-	Application package root
	__init__.py	-	Used by distutils to find the package root, should be empty
	module.py	-	Sample module which finds the associated resources
	resources/	-	Folder for static resources

Note 1: setup.py

"It has a limited syntax (see the docs),but basically:

include - pick up files (by glob or name) relative to the root.
recursive-include path file - pick up files (by name or glob) recursively under the given path.
You do not have to include any .py files in your package-root folder. You do have to include the runner script because it has no .py extension. (I am not sure if it would pick up .py files in the root.)"
